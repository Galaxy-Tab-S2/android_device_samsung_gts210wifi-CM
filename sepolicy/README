BOARD_SEPOLICY_DIRS defines the directory where the device-specific policy
files exist. BOARD_SEPOLICY_UNION means the final policy configuration is the
result of combining the general policy files and the device-specific policy
files. During the Android building procedure, the build system will check the
conflict between the different policies.
